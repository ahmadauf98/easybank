# **Easybank Mockup**

> Hello frontend developers! I have develop a mockup website (easybank) landing page using vue, nuxt and bootstrap. Sorry the code look like a bit messy as I put all codes in one page. Maybe I will separate those codes into component and make it more readable in the future. Shout out to Frontend Mentors!! If you wanna practice develop frontend website, you can check out frontend mentors. They will provide you the design and resources, so you can focus on your frontend development. I put the link in the credit developer below.
